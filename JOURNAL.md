## 10/5/2025 - Schematic + Footprints  

I spent around 1 hour doing the schematic. The reason it took me long is because at first I tried using a pico, but then realized that its not needed since the xiao has enough pins. I spent some time configuring the footprints, and I deleted and remade everything 2 times beacause I had a challenge with myself to finish the schematic with no external help.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTI1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--d34370bd21c884041d0b4422b40b8fa4598f1e45/image.png)
